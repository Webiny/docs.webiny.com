This is a simple bootstrap project to create a portfolio website with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Webiny Headless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/headless-cms) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

:::info
All the code shown in this tutorial is also hosted in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-bootstrap-react-portfolio/).

We will continue adding a series of bootstrap projects with different front-end frameworks.

Clone the bootstrap project and continue working on your portfolio website to showcase your work. Focus your creativity on creating valuable content and update your projects and blogs with [Webiny](webiny.com) [Headless CMS Content Models](http://docs.webiny.com/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/content-modeling).

* Projects

**Front-end:**
- Reusable UI components
- Material UI React Components

## Prerequisites

### Back-end
In order to have this project work, you need to have a Webiny Headless CMS project ready for the backend.
[Follow the tutorial](http://docs.webiny.com/docs/tutorials/build-a-portfolio-website-with-react-webiny-apollo#11-webiny-headless-cms-project) to create your `backend` Webiny project in the `webiny-bootstrap-react-portfolio` folder.

## Get Started

### Front-end
Clone the repository:

```
git clone 
cd webiny-bootstrap-react-portfolio/frontend
```
Start your front-end project:

Using yarn:
```
yarn install
yarn develop
```
Or, using npm:

```
npm install
npm run develop
```

## Deploy

### Back-end

When you create a Webiny project, one of the steps to finalize and continue working on the project is deployment. Make sure you have followed the [tutorial for the back-end set up.](http://docs.webiny.com/docs/tutorials/build-a-portfolio-website-with-react-webiny-apollo#11-webiny-headless-cms-project)
