---

In this tutorial, you will create a Habits Tracker API service, which will consist of the `Habit` model. By accessing the **`/graphql URL,`** you will read (query) and write (mutations) new data for our habits.

Webiny framework provides different scaffolding tools. What you will use is the GraphQL Apollo service scaffold to create the API service.

Before adding more functionalities, you will learn the `queries` and `mutations` in the `How to GraphQL` section. Then, you will test the GraphQL service with the out-of-the-box TDD setup from Webiny.

> You can find the example repo for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/serverless-graphql-api).

We have an [active community on slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack). If you struggle in any part of the tutorial, talk to the core-team, and get help. Webiny team is always there for any questions.

First, let’s go through the core concepts used in this tutorial.

## Core Concepts

### Serverless architecture

:::note
Serverless architectures are application designs that incorporate third-party “Backend as a Service” (BaaS) services, and/or that include custom code run in managed, ephemeral containers on a “Functions as a Service” (FaaS) platform.
Resource [here](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)
:::

### GraphQL

:::note
At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify what data it needs from an API. Instead of many endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with the data a client asked for. - Resources [here](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/).
:::

### Webiny

:::note
[Webiny](https://www.webiny.com/) is a platform for building serverless applications and APIs. Out of the box, Webiny provides a complete plugin based admin interface and a set of [ready-made apps](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-apps/). It is built for self-hosting on AWS.
:::
**Webiny** is the easiest way to adopt serverless.

It is created with technology and tools you know and Love:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) → For everything related to UI.
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) → for everything GraphQL (both React and API).
- [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/) → as our go-to database.
- [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) → to make coding with plugins as an enjoyable experience.

If you have ever used these technologies, **you already know Webiny = )**

## How to GraphQL

As noted in the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) website. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

### Core Concepts

Let’s go through the fundamental language constructs of GraphQL.

Defining **types** as well as sending **queries** and **mutations**.

We define the schema of our API with the GraphQL type system **[Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51) →** Which is the syntax for writing schemas.

### Fetching Data With Queries

As we noted earlier, the Main GraphQL API URL is the URL we care about the most. The Main GraphQL API is the single endpoint.

GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. It's completely flexible and lets the client decide what data is needed.

The client needs to send more information to the server to express its data needs. This information is called a Query.

```jsx
// The query

/*
    listHabits is called the root field of the query.
    Everything that follows the root field is called the payload of the query.
*/

{
  listHabits {
    title
    habitScore
  }
}

// The response
{
  "listHabits": [
    { "title": "Drink Water", "habitScore": 3 },
    { "title": "Run", "habitScore": 2 },
    { "title": "Journey", "habitScore": 3 }
  ]
}
/*
    The title was the only field that we specified in the queries payload.
    If we needed the habit score, all we need to do is include the habitScore
    the field in the query payload.
*/
```

In a GraphQL query, each field can have 0 or more arguments if specified in the GraphQL schema.

One of the significant strengths of GraphQL is it allows for querying nested information. For example, to load all the habits that each person has written as more info:

```jsx
{
  listAccountability {
    date
      habits {
        title
      }
  }
}
```

Next to requesting information from a server with _queries_, we can change server-side data through _mutations_.

With GraphQL, we do these changes with so-called **mutations**.

### Writing Data with Mutations

There are three kinds of mutations:

- **creating** new data
- **updating** existing data
- **deleting** existing data

Mutations generally follow the same syntactical structure as queries. What differentiates them from queries is that they always need to start with the **mutation** keyword.

Example mutation

```jsx
mutation {
  createHabit(title: "Drink Water", habitScore: 1) { // root Field - createHabit
    title
    habitScore
  }
}
```

Notice that similar to the query that you wrote before, the mutation also has a root field, the **createHabit** root field. You also learned about the concept of arguments for fields.

The `createHabit` fields take two arguments that specify the habits title and habit score. Like with the query, you are also able to determine the payload for the mutation, in which you can ask for different properties of a new person object.

Being able to query information when sending mutations can be a powerful tool that allows retrieval of data from the server in just a single round trip.

The server response from the above mutation will look as below.

```jsx
{
  "createHabit": {
    "title": "Drink Water",
    "habitScore": 1,
  }
}
```

Precisely as with queries, the server response is shaped according to the mutation that was sent.

## Prerequisites

To create the Serverless GraphQL API, you will need to set up a Webiny project.

The **base prerequisites** to create a Webiny project are:

1. **node.js >= 10.14.0**
2. **yarn < 2.0**
   - [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
   - or you can just run `npm install yarn -g`
3. **AWS account with an IAM user for programmatic usage**
   - you can follow [this guide](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/guides/aws-credentials)
4. **MongoDB database** in the cloud
   - We recommend [MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) if don't have a database already
   - You can follow [this guide](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/guides/mongodb-atlas) to create one

> Make sure to set up all the above requirements to continue with the next steps.

### Webiny Project

When you create your [Webiny project](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/get-started/quick-start#1-create-a-new-project) and deploy it with `yarn webiny deploy api --env=local`, the output of this command will look like below.

![Webiny project deploy result](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-project-deploy-result.png)

For now, the **Main GraphQL API** URL is what we care about the most.

Using this URL, you can access the _`GraphQL playground`_ in which you can see the complete GraphQL schema created from all of the services that Webiny provides.

Check out the schema below.

![Webiny project GraphQL playground](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-project-graphql-playground.png)

When you create your API service, you will see your APIs `Queries` and `Mutations` sections. That means you have successfully created and deployed our API service.

Learn more about _Webiny API Architecture [here](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/deep-dive/architecture/api/)._

## Serverless API with Webiny

### Webiny Project Structure

Before continuing to build the API service, let’s see how Webiny projects are organized.

Check out the Webiny [**serverless-api**](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/serverless-graphql-api) project structure in the image below:

![Webiny project structure](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-project-structure.png)

To learn more about the Webiny project structure, check out our docs **[here](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/deep-dive/project-structure)**.

The one folder that is important for us is the `API` folder.

![Webiny project API folder](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-project-api-folder.png)

As you can see, these are other folders of individual apps that Webiny provides out of the box. These folders represent the API code that is triggered in the Cloud.

> Our goal is to create our API service in the `api` folder.

:::info
In terms of deployments, the **resources.js** file is essential. In this file, we have all of the Cloud **[resources](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/deep-dive/architecture/resources)** that are necessary for the Webiny API to work.
:::

### Creating API Service

Webiny scaffold is a tool that you can use to set up different ready-made services. It offers you a couple of scaffolds.

The one we need for our project is the **GraphQL Apollo Scaffold**.

```bash
npx webiny scaffold
```

![Webiny GraphQL Apollo service scaffold](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-graphql-apollo-service-scaffold.png)

We will create a minimal API service, which we will name it the **habits-tracker** API. It will consist of one model, the habit model. You will be able to access the **`/graphql URL,`** by querying and writing new habits.

![Webiny GraphQL Apollo service location](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-gas-package-location.png)

You need to provide the location of our new API service in the `api` folder because the `API` folder represents the whole Webiny API stack, and that's the location where you want to have our API service.

Every Apollo service that you create consists of different models. The _core data model_ that you will have will be the **Habit** model.

![Webiny scaffold GraphQL Apollo Service model](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/webiny-scaffold-gas-model.png)

As you can see in the image below, the `habits-tracker` folder is inside the `API` folder. Except for the `habits-tracker` folder, there are some other changes.

![Habits Tracker API service](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-api-service.png)

We mentioned earlier, the **resources.js** file represents the whole cloud infrastructure that needs to be deployed. The scaffolding tool created another entry in the **resources.js** file that describes the newly added API. Check the image below.

![Habits Tracker resources](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-resources.png)

## Habits tracker API

We mentioned earlier that Webiny has a simple system of plugins that powers both the React apps and the API services. As soon as you begin developing something with Webiny, you'll be working with plugins.

The source code of the API service is in the `src` folder. The `plugins` folder is the place that contains all the plugins we are using.

![Habits Tracker source code structure](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-folder-structure.png)

The two most essential plugins are the **graphql** and the **model** plugin. We will go through each of the plugins and see what they represent.

![Habits Tracker plugins](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-plugins.png)

**Model plugin**

The **[models.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/src/plugins/models.ts)** file has a list of commodo models that we want our GraphQL to have.

:::info
[**Commodo**](https://github.com/webiny/commodo) is a set of higher order functions (HOFs) that let you define and **com**pose rich data **mod**el **o**bjects.
:::

The Commodo library is part of the Webiny project by default. It enables you to create data models.

**GraphQL plugin**

The **[graphql.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/src/plugins/graphql.ts)** file represents the schema we want the API to have. The scaffolding tool creates the whole schema for us. We will have basic **getHabit** and **listHabits** **queries** and the basic mutations in place such as **createHabit, deleteHabit,** and **updateHabit.**

This is a very convenient and _easy to start with_ for every developer to develop their custom API services.

## Deploy

To see the updated GraphQL schema, you need to deploy the created project by running this command.

```bash
yarn webiny deploy api --env=local
```

If you are deploying a completely new service, you deploy the whole API stack. After the first deploy of the created service, you can continue deploying only that particular API service.

Now you can open the Main GraphQL URL, and see the updated GraphQL schema with **Habits queries**.

![Habits Tracker query Habits](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-query-habits.png)

And the **Habits mutations**.

![Habits Tracker mutation habits](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-mutation-habits.png)

<!-- Writing data with the mutation. -->

<!-- ```jsx
// The request
mutation {
  habits {
    createHabit(data: {title: "Drink water"}) {
      data {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}

// The response
{
  "data": {
    "habits": {
      "createHabit": {
        "data": {
          "title": "Drink water"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Fetching with queries

```jsx
// The request
query {
  habits {
    listHabits {
      data {
        title
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
// The response
{
  "data": {
    "habits": {
      "listHabits": {
        "data": [
          {
            "title": "Drink water",
            "id": "5f14d446b59a9e0007f8d662"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
``` -->

## Extend the API service

We mentioned in the Habits Tracker API section that the scaffolding tool setup provides two plugins. They are the **graphql** and the **model** plugins.

![Habits Tracker plugins](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-plugins.png)

**Model plugin**

In the **[models.ts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/src/plugins/models.ts)** file, we will add another field in the Habit model such as `habitScore.` As shown in the image below

![Expand API service](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/expand-api-service.png)

After you change the model, you will need to change the GraphQL schema in the GraphQL too in the [`src/plugins/graphql.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/src/plugins/graphql.ts) file

You have the `Habit` type; besides the `Habit,` you will have the `input` type used for mutations in writing and updating data. So whenever you have the Habit Type mentioned, you need to add the `habitScore` field. You have the `Where` and `Sort` types that are used when you query for Habits.

See the changes in the image below.

![Extend Habit model](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/extend-habit-model.png)

Now you will deploy only the new API service you created, for the changes to take place in the cloud.

The API service name is in the `resources.js` file; you can look for the Habits-tracker entry. Check the image below.

![Habits Tracker resources](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-resources-api.png)

Deploy the new API service by running this command:

```tsx
yarn webiny deploy api apiHabitsTracker api --env=local
```

![Habits Tracker deploy after extending our API](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-deploy-extending-api.png)

As you can see, since you deployed the API Service, the deployment time is 13 seconds.

You can now open the Main GraphQL API and see the newly added fields in the Habit model.

![Habits Tracker habitScore field](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-habitscore-field.png)

Now, you can test out the API service by creating a new Habit. Check out the image below.

![Create new Habit - GraphQL Playground](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/graphql-playground-unauthorized.png)

As you can see, you got an error `Not authorized.` - To create new data, you need to create a Personal Access Token from the Admin UI. Check your profile by clicking on your image profile and then in your name.

![Personal Access Tokens in user profile](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/generate-access-token-to-access-graphql.png)

Click on the Personal Access Tokens field, as shown in the image below:

![Personal access token](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/pat-profile.png)

And provide a token name in the input, as shown in the image below.

![Pat name](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/pat-name.png)

Copy the provided Personal Access token

![Copy Pat](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/copy-pat.png)

Now we are ready to read queries and write mutations to the Habit model = )

Querying Habits

![Habit Tracker Query](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-query.png)

Creating Habits
![Habit Tracker mutation](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-mutation.png)

## Debug with TDD

One of the challenges of Cloud Development is debugging and slow iterations.

For every change you do, you have to deploy them to the Cloud to ensure everything works as expected.

The Debugging process is prolonged; you can use console logs in the code and then re-deploy the code to see the cloud watch logs.

To experience an excellent flow of work, you write tests. As you may be noticed, in the `Habits Tracker` folder, you had a folder called `__tests__.`

![Habits Tracker source code structure](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-folder-structure.png)

The scaffolding tool created the `__tests__` folder for us. With the existing tests, you are creating the local GraphQL Service, by creating the same function that the API Gateway will execute in the Cloud.

This enables us to invoke the function locally, and assert certain things are in order.

This process is much faster because by running the `yarn test` command, the tests that the scaffold created will be executed.

You have one test for the CRUD operations for the base model, and one for the validation if the title field is not valid. See the image below.

![Habits Tracker source code tests](/img/tutorials/serverless-graphql-api/habit-tracker-tdd-test.png)

The tests are passing because I already added the `habitScore` field on the tests.

As a practice, you can continue and add the changes in the [`__tests__/graphql/habits.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/__tests__/graphql/habits.js) file, and in the [`__tests__/crud.test.js`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/serverless-graphql-api/api/habits-tracker/__tests__/crud.test.js) file, to see if the tests will pass or fail.

You can expand your API with other functionalities, and by adding the tests, you can be assured that the API is working, by quickly debugging if something goes wrong.
