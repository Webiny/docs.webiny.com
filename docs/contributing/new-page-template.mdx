## Feature or Use Case Name

<!--If you are writing about a use case, start with a verb,
for example, "Configure", "Implement", + the goal/scenario-->

Write a description of the feature or use case. This introduction should answer
these questions:

- What is this feature or use case?
- Who is it for?
- What is the context in which it is used and are there any prerequisites or
  requirements?
- What can the audience do with this? (Be sure to consider all applicable
  audiences, such as GitLab admin and developer-user.)
- What are the benefits of using this over any existing alternatives?

## Use cases

Describe common use cases, typically in bulleted form. Include real-life examples
for each.

## Prerequisites

State any prerequisites for using the feature. These might include:

- Technical prereqs (for example, an account on a third-party service, an amount
  of storage space, or prior configuration of another feature)
- Prerequisite knowledge (for example, familiarity with certain GitLab features
  or other products and technologies).

Link each one to an appropriate place for more information.

## Tasks

Each topic should help users accomplish a specific task.

The heading should:

- Use title case (this tool helps - https://titlecaseconverter.com)
- Describe the task and start with a verb. For example, `Create a package` or
  `Configure a pipeline`.
- Be short and descriptive (up to ~50 chars).
- Start from an `h2` (`##`), then go over `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6` as needed.
  Never skip a hierarchy level (like `h2` > `h4`). It breaks the table of
  contents and can affect the breadcrumbs.

<!-- The following is optional, but can be pretty useful to users. -->
