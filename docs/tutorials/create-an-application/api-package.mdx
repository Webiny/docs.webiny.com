:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- how to quickly create a functional API package
:::


## Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed and to read our [Introduction](./introduction) tutorial.

## Overview
The API scaffold is our boilerplate GraphQL API that works out of the box without you needing to actually write any code.
It will enable you to create, update and delete the data in the database and fetch it via get and list API endpoints.
In this article we will go through the process of generating the code.

The command you will run is `yarn webiny scaffold`, and you run it from the project root.

You will get a set of simple questions to answer and, in the end, an API package will be generated.

Also note that in this tutorial we will use `CarManufacturer` as our data model name.

## Running the Scaffold
Run the scaffold command and follow the questions. Let's go through all the questions in detail:
##### 1. Enter the name of the initial data model
This is the name of your API data model, so type it in.
As mentioned before, we will use `CarManufacturer` in this tutorial.

The GraphQL queries, mutations, responses, and variable names in the code will use this value in singular and plural, kebab-case, camel-case or some other form.

```graphql title="graphql.ts"
type CarManufacturer {
    id: ID!
    createdOn: DateTime!
    savedOn: DateTime!
    createdBy: CreatedByResponse!
    title: String!
    description: String
    isNice: Boolean!
}
type CarManufacturerListResponse {
    data: [CarManufacturer]
    meta: CarManufacturerListMeta
    error: CarManufacturerError
}
```

The name value is also used to create both the defaults for the package location and the package name.

The initial data model has 3 fields (`title`, `description` and `isNice`) to show you how to structure your data model.

Validation of the data model name allows only **a-z** and **A-Z**.
You can name your model all lowercase or all uppercase. It is up to you - but try to keep it in pascal-case.

##### 2. Enter the package location
A full location of the package, where the package files will be generated, from the root of the project.
:::info
The value given in the previous question is used to create the default package location.
:::

We think it is best to organize your packages in `packages` directory, so by default it is set into that directory, but you can type whatever location you want.
:::note
To learn more about Webiny's project organization, checkout [this](../../key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) article.
:::

The default value is `packages/car-manufacturers/api`, and notice that the data model name `CarManufacturer` is in plural and kebab-cased.

##### 3. Enter the package name
The package name that you will reference to in the code.
:::info
As in the location step, the value from the first question is used to create the default package name.
:::

The default value is `@car-manufacturers/api` as we like scoping packages. You can set it to what ever you want, providing it is passing the validation.

## The Code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/index.ts` with `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` plugin type which defines the GraphQL schema and resolvers.
2. `src/configuration.ts` with the configuration for DynamoDB table, Elasticsearch DynamoDB stream table and Elasticsearch index.
3. `src/es.ts` with helpers to build the Elasticsearch query out of the GraphQL query arguments.
4. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for resolvers, application context, arguments.
5. `__tests__/useGqlHandler.ts` with the setup of the test runners.
6. `__tests__/graphql/carManufacturers.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations to be run.
7. `__tests__/crud.test.ts` with the tests for the resolvers.

## Elasticsearch
In the generated code we provide some basic Elasticsearch functionality.
Although the DynamoDB is the database the data is being stored to, it does not provide a lot of search capabilities so we introduced the Elasticsearch.

If you do not want to use it you will need to modify the code a bit for it to work without the Elasticsearch.

If you want to use the Elasticsearch functionality, that is provided with the generated code, you must run a GraphQL install mutation described in the information after the code was generated. This will create the Elasticsearch index for your data.

## Testing
The API scaffold generates initial GraphQL API tests for you. As you add or remove functionality from the code, tests should reflect those changes, so you can be sure that API is working as intended.

You can run tests locally with command `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200 LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH=true yarn test packages/car-manufacturers/api` or `yarn test packages/car-manufacturers/api`, if you removed the Elasticsearch.

Tests are Jest based and files must end in `.test.ts` to be run.

If you are using the Elasticsearch, you must have local Elasticsearch started for this to work. Port can be something other than **9200**.

Generated tests cover CRUD operations and sorting by `createdOn` and `title` fields.

## Using the Generated Code in Your Project
In the main GraphQL file you need to import your package and include it in the existing handler.
```typescript title="api/code/graphql/src/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import carManufacturerPlugin from "@car-manufacturers/api";

// somewhere after headlessCmsPlugins() in the end of the createHandler() function
carManufacturerPlugin()
```
## Deploy the API
To use the generated GraphQL API, you must deploy it. To deploy, use the command:
```
yarn webiny deploy api --env YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

## Accessing the API
When you deploy the code you will get a URL of the API, it should look something like `https://m19ckhk09hc31l.cloudfront.net`.

GraphQL is accessible on that url with addition of `/graphql`, so it is `https://m19ckhk09hc31l.cloudfront.net/graphql`.

To create new `CarManufacturer` entry, the mutation is:
```graphql
mutation CreateCarManufacturerMutation {
	carManufacturers {
		createCarManufacturer(data: {
			title: "Mercedes",
			isNice: true,
			description: "A nice car manufacturer"
		}) {
			data {
				id
				title
				isNice
				description
				createdOn
				savedOn
				createdBy {
					id
					displayName
					type
				}
			}
			error {
				message
				code
				data
			}
		}
	}
}
```

To list all the `CarManufacturer` entries, the query is:
```graphql
query ListCarManufacturerQuery {
	carManufacturers {
		listCarManufacturers {
			data {
				id
				title
				isNice
				description
				createdOn
				savedOn
				createdBy {
					id
					displayName
					type
				}
			}
			meta {
				cursor
				hasMoreItems
				totalCount
			}
			error {
				message
				code
				data
			}
		}
	}
}
```
## Adding Additional Schema to the Code
When you want to extend the GraphQL schema you should add it to the `typeDefs` property of the `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` in `packages/car-manufacturers/api/src/index.ts` file.

## Adding Additional Resolvers to the Code
When you add some additional schema, you also must add the resolver for it.
You should add it to the `resolvers` property of the `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` in `packages/car-manufacturers/api/src/index.ts` file.

Be aware that the resolver should be under the `CarManufacturerQuery` or `CarManufacturerMutation` properties, if you added schema into those.

## Building the Code
When you make changes to the code, make sure you run `yarn webiny ws run build --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/api` to actually compile your code for the deployment.

You can even have a watcher running for your code with `yarn webiny ws run watch --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/api`.

Of course, the `folder` value is your package location.

## Next Step...
Now that you have a functioning API, let's move onto the [Admin area](./admin-area-package).
