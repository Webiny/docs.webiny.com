:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- what are scaffolds
- how to quickly create a functional app Admin area app
:::


## Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed and to read our [Intro](./create-an-application-intro) and [API Package](./api-package) tutorials.

## Overview
The UI scaffold is our boilerplate code that works out of the box without you needing to actually write any code.
In this article we will go through the process of generating the code.

The command you will need is `yarn webiny scaffold`.

In our example we will use `CarManufacturer` as our reference.


## Admin Area Package Scaffold
### Running the Scaffold
Run the scaffold command and follow the questions. Let's go through all the questions in detail:
##### 1. Enter the name of the initial data model
Name of the Admin area data model. The GraphQL queries, mutations, responses, variable names in the code and files will use this value in singular and plural, kebab-case, camel-case or some other form.

The name value is used to create both the defaults for the package location and the package name.

The initial data model has 3 fields (`title`, `description` and `isNice`) to show you how to structure your data model.

Validation of the data model name allows only a-z and A-Z.
You can name your model all lowercase or all uppercase. It is up to you - but try to keep it in pascal-case.

##### 2. Enter the package location
A full location of the package from the root of the project. A data model name value given in the previous question is used to create the default package location.

We think it is best to organize your packages in `packages` directory, so by default it is set into that directory, but you can change it to whatever you want.

The default value is `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app`. Notice that the data model name `CarManufacturer` is in plural and kebab-cased.

Validation of the package location checks only if the given directory already exists.

##### 3. Enter the package name
The package name that you reference to in the code. As in the location step, the data model name value is used to create the default package name.

The default value is `@car-manufacturers/admin-app` as we like scoping packages. You can set it to what ever you want, providing it is passing the validation.

Validation of the package name is done via the `validate-npm-package-name` package.

### The Code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/views/graphql.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations for the data model.
2. `src/views/CarManufacturers.tsx` with a React component that renders both the list view and the form.
3. `src/views/CarManufacturersDataList.tsx` with a React component that lists existing data models via the GraphQL queries.
4. `src/views/CarManufacturerForm.tsx` which utilizes our `@webiny/form` package to display and populate the form.
5. `src/rotues.tsx` with `RoutePlugin` definition to add the route in the admin area.
6. `src/menus.tsx` with `AdminMenuPlugin` definition to display the menu in the admin area.
7. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for entry items and data list props.
8. `src/index.ts` with exports of the plugins to be used in the admin app.

### Using the Generated Code in Your Project
In the main admin app file you need to import your package and include it in the plugin registration array.
```typescript title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import carManufacturerPlugin from "@car-manufacturers/admin-app";

// in the end of the registration array
carManufacturerPlugin()
```

## Changing the Form
Let's say you want to add a new field named `country` to identify where is the Car manufacturer located.

You would add a new Cell component with Bind and Input components to the existing form, something like this:
```tsx title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/CarManufacturerForm.tsx"
<Cell span={12}>
    <Bind name="country">
        <Input label={"Country"} />
    </Bind>
</Cell>
```

You need to change GraphQL as well, for example we will add it into mutation for creating the entry:

```typescript title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/graphql.ts"
export const CREATE_CAR_MANUFACTURER = gql`
    mutation CreateCarManufacturer($data: CarManufacturerCreateInput!) {
        carManufacturers {
            createCarManufacturer(data: $data) {
                data {
                    id
                    title
                    description
                    isNice
					# add new field here
					country
					#
                    createdOn
                    savedOn
                    createdBy {
                        id
                        displayName
                        type
                    }
                }
                error {
                    code
                    message
                    data
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

You need to make changes in other mutations and queries as well.

## Changing the List

After you have the `country` field, you want to be able to sort by it. You would add it to the sorters in the data list component:
```tsx title="packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/views/CarManufacturersDataList.tsx"
const sorters = [
    {
        label: "Newest to oldest",
        value: "createdOn_DESC"
    },
    {
        label: "Oldest to newest",
        value: "createdOn_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Tile A-Z",
        value: "title_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Title Z-A",
        value: "title_DESC"
    },
    // add sorters here
    {
        label: "Country A-Z",
        value: "country_ASC"
    },
    {
        label: "Country Z-A",
        value: "country_DESC"
    }
];
```

## Adding the Menu

If you want to add some new menu in the Admin area, check out the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/menus.tsx` file.
You can make a copy of that file, name it `myMenu.tsx` and import it into the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/index.ts`.

## Adding the Route

If you want your created menu to load some route, check out the `packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app/src/routes.tsx` file.
Also, you can copy that file and change what you require. Remember to import it into the `index.ts` file.

## Building the Code
When you make changes to the code, make sure you run `yarn webiny ws run build --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app` to actually compile your code for the deployment.

You can even have a watcher running for your code with `yarn webiny ws run watch --folder=packages/car-manufacturers/admin-app`.

Of course, the `folder` value is your package location.

### Run locally
Unlike the API, you can run the UI locally:
1. `cd apps/admin/code`
2. `yarn start --env=YOUR_ENVIRONMENT`

This will start the local build of the Admin app. Also, it will automatically rebuild and refresh when it detects changes in the code.


### Deploy the Admin App
Use the command to deploy the admin app:
```
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

## Next Step...
Now you have the functional UI in the admin area to create, update, delete, and list the CarManufacturers.
