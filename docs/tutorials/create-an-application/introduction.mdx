:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- how to get started with building a Webiny app
- what are scaffolds
- how to run scaffolding
:::

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed.

You can read on how to install it in our [Install Webiny](/docs/tutorials/install-webiny) article.

## Scaffold

Scaffolding is the easiest way to build apps and APIs in Webiny.
Using a scaffold you will generate your app or an API.
You will get all of the required code automatically created for you.
This is a great starting point, as then you can just modify and adapt the code to your needs, without dealing with much of the boilerplate work.

There are several scaffolds that ship with Webiny, including the Admin area scaffold and the API scaffold, which we will explore more in this tutorial.
All scaffolds have a wizard that guides you through the process by asking you a set of simple questions.
More on that in the actual tutorial.

:::note
You can add your own custom scaffolds by building a [CLI plugin](/docs/tutorials/webiny-cli/adding-custom-commands) and using the current scaffold plugin as a [reference](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/src/index.ts).

## Workspaces

For you to be able to import the generated packages into your application they must be linked to the `node_modules`.
It is done automatically by our [linkWorkspaces](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/scripts/linkWorkspaces.js) script and is called by `yarn postinstall`.
Also, you can run `yarn link-workspaces` manually to link the packages.

To find out more about workspaces read the official yarn [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Remember, packages you want to link must be in root **package.json** `workspaces.packages` array.

:::warning
If you are creating packages in a directory that is not your projects `./packages/` directory, you must add that directory to the `whitelist` array in the `./scripts/linkWorkspaces.js`, otherwise linking will not work.
