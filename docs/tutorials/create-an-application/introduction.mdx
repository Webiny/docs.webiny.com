## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed.

You can read on how to install it in our [Install Webiny](/docs/tutorials/install-webiny) article.

## Scaffold

Scaffolding is the easiest way to build apps and APIs in Webiny.
Using a scaffold you will generate your app or an API.
You will get all of the required code automatically created for you.
This is a great starting point, as then you can just modify and adapt the code to your needs, without dealing with much of the boilerplate work.

There are several scaffolds that ship with Webiny, including the Admin area scaffold and the API scaffold, which we will explore more in this tutorial.
All scaffolds have a wizard that guides you through the process by asking you a set of simple questions.
More on that in the actual tutorial.

:::note
You can add your own custom scaffolds by building a [CLI plugin](/docs/tutorials/webiny-cli/adding-custom-commands) and using the current scaffold plugin as a [reference](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/src/index.ts).

## Workspaces

We link all our packages to `node_modules` via workspaces (read about them in yarn [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)), so we can use their name to import them in our applications.
Packages are linked by default via `yarn postinstall`. If you want to link them manually, run `yarn link-packages`.
:::note
By default, the packages located in `./packages/` directory are linked. If you want to create a package that is outside that directory, you must add yours to the linkPackages script.

The script is located in `./scripts/linkWorkspaces.js`. You must add your directory into the `whitelist` array, otherwise package linking will not pick up your packages.
