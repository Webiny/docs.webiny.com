:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- what are scaffolds
- how to run scaffolding
:::

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed.

You can read on how to install it in our [Install Webiny](../install-webiny) article.

## Scaffold

You will use `yarn webiny scaffold` to start the scaffolding, and you run it from the root of the project.
The process is quite simple as we show you a list of possible scaffolds which you can select.
We then show you a question by question or a statement by statement and you provide some answer to it.

For example, in our API scaffold process you have a request: `Enter the name of the initial data model`. You just need to type the name of the data model, let's say `Car`.
Continue through the rest of the questions until the scaffolding process is done.

## Workspaces

For you to be able to import the package into the API or Admin app it must be linked to the `node_modules`.
It is done automatically by our [linkWorkspaces](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/scripts/linkWorkspaces.js) script which is called by `yarn postinstall`.

Also, you can run `yarn link-workspaces` manually to link the packages.

Remember, packages you want linked must be in root **project.json** `workspaces.packages` array.

##### Linking packages that are not in **packages** directory
If you are linking packages in a directory that is not `packages`, you must add that directory in the `whitelist` array.
