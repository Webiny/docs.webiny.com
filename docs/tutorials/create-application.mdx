:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- what are scaffolds
- how to quickly create a functional app with both UI and API
:::

## Overview
UI and API scaffolds are our boilerplate code that works out of the box without you needing to actually write any code.
We will go through the process of generating the code for both UI and API packages.

The command you will need is `yarn webiny scaffold`. Of course, you run it from the root of your project.

For you to be able to import the package into the api or apps code, via its name, it must be linked to the `node_modules`.
It is done automatically by our [linkWorkspaces](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/scripts/linkWorkspaces.js) script which is called by `yarn postinstall`.

Only thing you need to change in it, if you are generating packages somewhere other than packages directory, is the `whitelist` param - just add your package directory to the array.

In our examples we will use `CarManufacturer` as our reference.

## API package scaffold

### Running the scaffold
Run the scaffold command and go follow the questions. Here is the detailed explanation of the questions:
##### 1. Enter the name of the initial data model
Name of the API model. The GraphQL queries, mutations and responses will use this name in singular and plural form.

Name value is also used to create both the defaults for the package location and the package name.

Initially created data model has 3 fields (`title`, `description` and `isNice`) to show you how to build your data model.

Validation of the data model name allows only a-z and A-Z. You can name your model all lowercase or all uppercase, that is up to you - but try to keep it in pascal-case.

##### 2. Enter the package location
Full location of the package - from the root of the project. A data model name given in previous question is used to create the default package location.

By default, we think it is best to organize your packages in `packages` directory, but you can change that to what ever you want.

Default value is `packages/carManufacturers/api`. Notice that data model name `CarManufacturer` is in plural and camel-cased.

Validation of the package location checks only if the given directory already exists.

##### 3. Enter the package name
The package name that you will reference to in the code. As in the location step, data model name is used to create the default package name.

Default value is `@carManufacturers/api`.

Validation of the package name is done via the `validate-npm-package-name` package.


### The code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/index.ts` with `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` plugin type which defines the GraphQL schema and resolvers.
2. `src/configuration.ts` with configuration for DynamoDB table, Elasticsearch DynamoDB stream table and Elasticsearch index.
3. `src/es.ts` with helpers to build the Elasticsearch query out of the GraphQL query arguments.
4. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for resolvers, application context, arguments, etc...
5. `__tests__/useGqlHandler.ts` with the setup of the test runners.
6. `__tests__/graphql/carManufacturers.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations to be ran.
7. `__tests__/crud.test.ts` with the tests for the resolvers.

### Elasticsearch
If you want to use the Elasticsearch functionality that is provided with the generated code you must run install mutation described in the information after the code was generated.

### Testing
You can run tests locally with command `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200 LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH=true yarn test packages/carManufacturers/api`.
You need to have local Elasticsearch started for this to work and port can be something other than **9200**.

Generated tests cover CRUD operations and sorting by `createdOn` and `title` fields.
