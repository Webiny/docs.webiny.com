:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- what are scaffolds
- how to quickly create a functional app with both UI and API
:::

## Overview
UI and API scaffolds are our boilerplate code that works out of the box without you needing to actually write any code.
We will go through the process of generating the code for both UI and API packages.

The command you will need is `yarn webiny scaffold`. Of course, you run it from the root of your project.

For you to be able to import the package into the API or Admin app it must be linked to the `node_modules`.
It is done automatically by our [linkWorkspaces](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/scripts/linkWorkspaces.js) script which is called by `yarn postinstall`.

If you are generating packages in a directory that is not `packages`, you must add that directory in the `whitelist` array.

In our examples we will use `CarManufacturer` as our reference.

## API Package Scaffold

### Running the Scaffold
Run the scaffold command and follow the questions. Here is a detailed explanation of the questions:
##### 1. Enter the name of the initial data model
Name of the API model. The GraphQL queries, mutations and responses will use this name in singular and plural form.

The name value is used to create both the defaults for the package location and the package name.

The initial data model has 3 fields (`title`, `description` and `isNice`) to show you how to build your data model.

Validation of the data model name allows only a-z and A-Z.
You can name your model all lowercase or all uppercase. It is up to you - but try to keep it in pascal-case.

##### 2. Enter the package location
A full location of the package from the root of the project. A data model name given in the previous question is used to create the default package location.

By default, we think it is best to organize your packages in `packages` directory, but you can change that to whatever you want.

The default value is `packages/car-manufacturers/api`. Notice that the data model name `CarManufacturer` is in plural and kebab-cased.

Validation of the package location checks only if the given directory already exists.

##### 3. Enter the package name
The package name that you reference to in the code. As in the location step, the data model name is used to create the default package name.

The default value is `@car-manufacturers/api`.

Validation of the package name is done via the `validate-npm-package-name` package.


### The Code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/index.ts` with `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` plugin type which defines the GraphQL schema and resolvers.
2. `src/configuration.ts` with the configuration for DynamoDB table, Elasticsearch DynamoDB stream table and Elasticsearch index.
3. `src/es.ts` with helpers to build the Elasticsearch query out of the GraphQL query arguments.
4. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for resolvers, application context, arguments.
5. `__tests__/useGqlHandler.ts` with the setup of the test runners.
6. `__tests__/graphql/carManufacturers.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations to be run.
7. `__tests__/crud.test.ts` with the tests for the resolvers.

### Elasticsearch
If you want to use the Elasticsearch functionality that is provided with the generated code you must run install mutation described in the information after the code was generated.

### Testing
You can run tests locally with command `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200 LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH=true yarn test packages/car-manufacturers/api`.
You must have local Elasticsearch started for this to work. Port can be something other than **9200**.

Generated tests cover CRUD operations and sorting by `createdOn` and `title` fields.

### Using the Generated Code in Your Project
In the main GraphQL file you need to import your package and include it in the existing handler.
```typescript title="api/code/graphql/src/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import carManufacturerPlugin from "@car-manufacturers/api";

// somewhere after headlessCmsPlugins() in the end of the createHandler() function
carManufacturerPlugin()
```
### Deploy the API
Use the command to deploy the API:
```
yarn webiny deploy api --env YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

Now that you have a functioning API, let's move onto the UI side.

## Admin Area Package Scaffold
### Running the Scaffold
Run the scaffold command and follow the questions. The questions are as the ones in the API package scaffold, functionality behind them as well.

### The Code
Generated code contains:
1. `src/views/graphql.ts` with GraphQL queries and mutations for the data model.
2. `src/views/CarManufacturers.tsx` with a React component that renders both the list view and the form.
3. `src/views/CarManufacturersDataList.tsx` with a React component that lists existing data models via the GraphQL queries.
4. `src/views/CarManufacturerForm.tsx` which utilizes our `@webiny/form` package to display and populate the form.
5. `src/rotues.tsx` with `RoutePlugin` definition to add the route in the admin area.
6. `src/menus.tsx` with `AdminMenuPlugin` definition to display the menu in the admin area.
7. `src/types.ts` with interfaces for entry items and data list props.
8. `src/index.ts` with exports of the plugins to be used in the admin app.

### Using the Generated Code in Your Project
In the main admin app file you need to import your package and include it in the plugin registration array.
```typescript title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import carManufacturerPlugin from "@car-manufacturers/admin-app";

// in the end of the registration array
carManufacturerPlugin()
```

### Deploy the Admin App
Use the command to deploy the admin app:
```
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

And now you have the functional UI in the admin area to create, update, delete, and list the CarManufacturers.
