Aliases go in hand with envs (environments), they define the GraphQL endpoint. Where the content and model will get served.

Aliases can link to one env and unlink to another env. This allows instant changes between different versions of your content.

For example, you might have a `production` alias, which points to env `A`, then you create a `copy of A`, let's call it `B`. When you are ready, you would update the alias and make it point to `B`.

So, the API URL didnâ€™t change, but the env behind it did.

For example: `https://dfgk2kz3e3qhn.cloudfront.net/cms/read/production`.

The `production` keyword in the url is the Alias slug.
