Roles & Permissions is another feature of Headless CMS :)

You can find roles in the menu shown in the image below:

The authentications and permissions are part of the Webiny core package and they also pass on to the Headless CMS. Create users, user groups, roles and permissions to control who and how they access the system.
In addition to roles and permissions, each user can control their own set of personal access tokens.

#### Summary of roles

Before getting started, following is a summary of the four main roles:

* Full Access - This role gives full access to all available resources. Be careful to whom you assign this role!

* Security - Users - Allows management of users.

* Security - Group - Allows management of groups.

* Security - Roles - Allows management of roles.

### Personal access tokens
