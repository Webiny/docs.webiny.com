Triggers are special actions which are executed once a user makes a successful form submissions.

For example, once the user successfully submits the form, you might want to redirect him to a different page, or maybe even fire a separate POST request to another service of your choice. This request will contain all the submitted data of course.

You can set this up via the "Triggers" tab in the fields editor section in the form builder. There are two triggers that are offered by default: redirect and webhook.

Note that if you need something more custom or advanced, you can even create your own custom triggers. Click [here](/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/custom-form-triggers) if you want to find out more on this topic.
