## Overview
Webiny CLI Simple React Component Package Scaffold is the tool that you'll be using to generate a React component package.

It generates a React component, links it in the `node_modules` and exports it for usage in your applications.

Of course, you can modify it to whatever you require.


## Command

To start the scaffolding, run the command:
```
yarn webiny scaffold
```
And then choose the `Simple React component package` option.

## Details

There are a few questions that you will need to go through before the actual component is generated. Questions are:

#### 1. Enter the name of the component (in pascal-case)
The name of your component. It is used when importing the component from the package and in some parts of the code.

#### 2. Enter the package location
The location of your component from the root of the project.

By the default location is `packages/your-component-name`, where `your-component-name` is kebab-cased name that you have given in the previous answer.

#### 3. Enter the package name
The full package name of your component.
It is used for the import of the component in the package and when publishing to the registry.

By the default package name is `@custom-components/your-component-name`, where `your-component-name` is kebab-cased name that you have given in the first answer.
