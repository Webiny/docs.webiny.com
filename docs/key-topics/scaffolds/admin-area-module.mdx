:::tip What you'll learn
- how to generate a Admin Area Module
:::

## Overview
Webiny CLI Admin Area Module Scaffold is the tool that you'll be using to generate a simple React application for our Admin Area.
It is meant to work, out of the box, with our scaffolded [GraphQL API](/docs/key-topics/scaffolds/graphql-api) as it contains the UI for all the generated API operations.

Of course, you can modify it to whatever you require.

## Command

To start the scaffolding, run the command
```
yarn webiny scaffold
```
And then choose the `Admin Area package` option.

## Details

For more details on the questions read our [Admin Area Package](/docs/tutorials/create-an-application/admin-area-package) tutorial.
