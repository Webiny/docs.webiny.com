:::tip What you'll learn
- how to use the Headless CMS Webiny application's built-in GraphQL API
:::

## Overview

The Headless CMS Webiny application comes with a fully fledged GraphQL API, which you can use in order to perform GraphQL queries and mutations on the Headless CMS content models and content entries.

The easiest way to explore it and try different things is via the API Playground, that's part of the Webiny Administration Area. To access it, simply open the main menu on the left side of the screen, and click on the API Playground:

## Main Characteristics

### GraphQL API Types

The Headless CMS GraphQL API comes in three different types - **manage**, **preview** and **read**. Each type is served via a separate URL, and has a specific purpose.

#### Manage

The manage GraphQL API is here for management purposes. In other words, it provides the necessary queries and mutations for managing your content models and content entries. It is heavily utilized by the Headless CMS module in the Webiny Administration Area.

Except the fact that this GraphQL API type allows you to create new and edit and publish existing content entries, another specific aspect of it is that it returns both published and unpublished content entries. This is intentional, because, as a content manager, you need to be able to access all of the data, not just published.

#### Read

Unlike the manage GraphQL API, which is used by content managers, the **read** API is used by data consumers - like your public website, a web or mobile application, and others. The API consists of multiple query operations that enable you to retrieve content entries, previously published via the mentioned **management** GraphQL API.

#### Preview

Finally, there is the **preview** GraphQL API type, which is used for previewing purposes. Imagine a website that's only available to the internal team, that wants to see how a particular page or a section of your website will look like, once the content entry is actually published. This internal website is available under a protected URL, and points to the **preview** GraphQL API.

The GraphQL schema is the same as the one that the **read** GraphQL API represents, except the returned data will also include not-yet published content entries.

### Summary

The following table clearly shows all of the specific characteristics of each Headless CMS GraphQL API type:
