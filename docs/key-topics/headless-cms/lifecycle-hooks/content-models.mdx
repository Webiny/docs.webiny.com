## Before you start
You should read about Webiny plugins and the key topic on content models.

## Overview
We will go through a list of hooks that you can define to be executed. We will also give some examples on how the hooks can be used.

For the article we will assume that we have some remote service, named `ModelService`, that also stores models. Also, we will split hook plugins to simplify the examples.

In the hooks you can modify the values of the model object, but we do not recommend it.

## Plugin type
The plugin type to define the hooks is [CmsContentModelHookPlugin](../../references/headless-cms/api/cmscontentmodelhookplugin.mdx).

All hooks are async and are executed in the order the plugins were registered. You can check that [here](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/crud/contentModel/runContentModelLifecycleHooks.ts).

Each hook receives `context` and `model` as a part of argument object, except the `beforeSave` hook which also receives modified `data` object.

## Hooks
### Before create
This hook is triggered before we store the content model to the storage.

We use this hook to verify that `modelId` is a unique one in our system.


What can you do in this hook? You can run a check to make sure that `modelId` is unique in the `ModelService`:
```ts title="modelServiceBeforeCreate.ts"
const modelServiceBeforeCreate = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	beforeCreate: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const result = await modelServiceApi.fetch(modelid);
	    if (result === null) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`Model id "${modelId}" already exists in "ModelService".`);
	}
});
```

### After create
This hook is triggered after the content model was successfully stored.

What can you do in this hook? You can now store the model to the remote service:
```ts title="modelServiceAfterCreate.ts"
const modelServiceAfterCreate = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	afterCreate: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const result = await modelServiceApi.store({
			id: model.modelId,
			name: model.name,
			group: model.group.id,
	    });
	    if (result) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`Could not store model "${modelId}" to "ModelService".`);
	}
});
```


### Before update
This hook is triggered before we store the updated content model to the storage.
This is a bit specific hook since it receives a data object which contains changes from the input.
Arguments interface is [CmsContentModelUpdateHookPluginArgs](../../reference/headless-cms/api/cmscontentmodelupdatehookpluginargs.mdx).

We use this hook to check if `titleFieldId` changed and if it is set correctly according to our specifications.
Also, we check if any field that has been used in the entries was removed or changed, and we do not allow it.

What can you do in this hook? You can check if model exists in the `ModelService`.
```ts title="modelServiceBeforeUpdate.ts"
const modelServiceBeforeUpdate = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	beforeUpdate: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const result = await modelServiceApi.fetch(modelId);
	    if (result) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`Could not find model "${modelId}"`);
	}
});
```


### After update
This hook is triggered after we store the content model to the storage.

We use this hook to update the internal cache for the GraphQL schema.

What can you do in this hook? You can update the model in the `ModelService`.
```ts title="modelServiceAfterUpdate.ts"
const modelServiceAfterUpdate = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	afterUpdate: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const result = await modelServiceApi.store({
			id: model.modelId,
			name: model.name,
			group: model.group.id,
	    });
	    if (result) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`Could not store model "${modelId}" to "ModelService".`);
	}
});
```

### Before delete
This hook is triggered before we delete the content model from the storage.

We use this hook to make sure that there are no entries in given content model. We do not allow deletion of content models that have entries.

What can you do in this hook? You can check if model has some related data in the `ModelService`.
```ts title="modelServiceBeforeDelete.ts"
const modelServiceBeforeDelete = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	beforeDelete: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const results = await modelServiceApi.fetchRelated(modelId, {
	        limit: 1
	    });
	    if (results.length === 0) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`It appears that "${modelId}" has some related data in the "ModelService".`);
	}
});
```

### After delete
This hook is triggered after we delete the content model from the storage.

We use this hook to update the internal cache for the GraphQL schema.

What can you do in this hook? You can delete the model from the `ModelService`.
```ts title="modelServiceAfterDelete.ts"
const modelServiceAfterDelete = (): CmsContentModelHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-model-hook",
	afterDelete: async({model}): Promise<void> => {
	    const {modelId} = model;
	    const result = await modelServiceApi.delete(modelId);
	    if (result) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`It appears that "${modelId}" cannot be deleted from "ModelService".`);
	}
});
```
