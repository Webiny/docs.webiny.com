:::

## Before you start
You should read about Webiny plugins and the key topic on content entries.

## Overview
We will go through a list of hooks that you can define to be executed. We will also give some examples on how the hooks can be used.

For the article we will assume that we have some remote service, named `EntryService`, which starts build of some sort and store entries. Also, we will split hook plugins to simplify the examples.

In the hooks you can modify the values of the entry object, but we do not recommend it.

## Plugin type
The plugin type to define the hooks is [CmsContentEntryHookPlugin](../../references/headless-cms/api/cmscontententryhookplugin.mdx).

All hooks are async and are executed in the order the plugins were registered. You can check that [here](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/crud/contentEntry/runContentEntryLifecycleHooks.ts).

Each hook receives `context`, `model` and `entry` as a part of argument object.

## Hooks

### Before create
This hook is triggered before we store the entry data to the storage.

We use this hook to lock fields on the `model` - to make sure they cannot be changed or deleted.

What can you do in this hook? You can run a check to make sure that entry with same name does not exist in the remote `EntryService`.
```ts title="entryServiceBeforeCreate.ts"
const entryServiceBeforeCreate = (): CmsContentEntryHookPlugin => ({
	type: "content-entry-hook",
	beforeCreate: async({entry}): Promise<void> => {
	    const result = await entryServiceApi.fetch({
			name: entry.values.name,
	    });
	    if (result === null) {
	        return;
	    }
	    throw new Error(`Entry with name "${entry.values.name}" already exists in "EntryService".`);
	}
});
```
