:::tip What youâ€™ll learn

- how does Page Builder responsive mode works.
:::

In Webiny `v5` the Page Builder editor comes with responsive mode which helps building a responsive website straight from the editor.

<img
  src={require("../../assets/page-builder/pb-responsive-mode-toolbar.png").default}
  className="no-shadow"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Page Builder toolbar"
/>

The top toolbar contains a preset of device breakpoint:

- `desktop`
- `tablet`
- `mobile-landscape`
- `mobile-portrait`

:::info
You can also add new breakpoint and/or replace existing one via plugins. More on that later.
:::

By click on these presets you can view the page in that particular viewport as well as make style changes using sidebar for that particular breakpoint.

:::note
Not all style settings are sive.
:::

Whether a style setting is responsive or not is denoted by the device icon as shown in the image below:

<img
  src={require("../../assets/page-builder/pb-sidebar-device-icon.png").default}
  className="no-shadow"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Page Builder sidebar"
/>

:::info
The `device` icon changes with the responsive mode selected on the top toolbar. It indicate for which breakpoint these settings apply.
:::

## Cascading of style

`desktop` is the base breakpoint which means all the styles applied to it **"cascade"** downwards to small breakpoints.
For t's say you set the background color property of a `grid` to orange in `desktop` mode.
It also apply to all smaller breakpoints i.e `tablet`, `mobile-landscape` and `mobile-portrait`.

<video controls style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  <source
    src={require("../../assets/page-builder/pb-responsive-mode-desktop.mp4").default}
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }} />

Of course you can override a particular style for a particular breakpoint by selecting that via top toolbar
and making ired changes to style settings via sidebar. Continuing our previous example, if we need the `grid` to be of `green` background on `mobile-landscape`
 we can simply select that mode from top toolbar and change the background color in style settings.

<video controls style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  <source
    src={require("../../assets/page-builder/pb-responsive-mode-mobile.mp4").default}
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }} />

Notice that even though you only changed the `grid` style on `mobile-landscape` mode
it also gets applied to the smaller breakpoint in this case `mobile-portrait`.
This is because in Page Builder editor responsive mode implementation style `cascade` downwards.
