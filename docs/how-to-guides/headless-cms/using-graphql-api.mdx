- how to use the Headless CMS Webiny application's built-in GraphQL API

The main advantage of this approach is that you already have all of the relevant GraphQL API URLs and authentication set up, so you don't need to set these manually.

## Programmatic Access

Except for the API Playground, the GraphQL API can also be accessed programmatically, via a GraphQL client or a library of your choice. Some of the examples are [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), and [graphql-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request).

The first step is to decide with which type of the GraphQL API you wish to interact with (manage, read, or preview), and with for which locale. These two parameters affect the complete URL you'll need to point your GraphQL to.

In terms of the actual URL, you can retrieve it either via the API Playground shown above,
