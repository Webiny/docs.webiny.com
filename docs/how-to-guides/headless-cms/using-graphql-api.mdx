:::tip What you'll learn
- how to use the Headless CMS Webiny application's built-in GraphQL API
:::

## Overview

The Headless CMS Webiny application comes with a fully-fledged GraphQL API, which you can use in order to perform GraphQL queries and mutations on Headless CMS content models and content entries.

:::info
To learn more about the Headless CMS GraphQL API and its main characteristics, make sure to check out the [Headless CMS GraphQL API](/docs/key-topics/webiny-applications/headless-cms/graphql-api) key topic.

## API Playground

The easiest way to explore Headless CMS GraphQL API and try different things is via the API Playground, which's part of the Webiny Administration Area. To access it, simply open the main menu on the left side of the screen, and click on the API Playground:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("./using-graphql-api/api_playground_from_main_menu.png").default}
  className="no-shadow"
  alt="Access API Playground via Main Menu"
/>

<!-- vale on -->


The API Playground enables you to easily access all three Headless CMS GraphQL API types (**read**, **manage**, **preview**). You can also access content in different locales, by switching to a different locale via the locale selector, located in the top right corner of the screen.

<CenteredImage alt="Switch Locale via the Locale Selector" src={apiPlaygroundSwitchLocale} />

:::info
Note that the locale selector is not visible for systems that have only one active locale.

## Programmatic Access

### GraphQL Client
Except for the API Playground, the Headless CMS GraphQL API can also be accessed programmatically, via a GraphQL client or a library of your choice. Some of the common clients out there are [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), and [graphql-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request).

### Headless CMS GraphQL API URL
Once you have your GraphQL client set up and ready to go, we first need to retrieve the correct Headless CMS GraphQL API URL, which can be done either via the API Playground or via the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli).

:::info
Note that the exact URL is different for different combinations of Headless CMS GraphQL API types and locales. To learn more about the structure of the Headless CMS GraphQL API URL and how to retrieve it, please check out the [Headless CMS GraphQL API URL](/docs/key-topics/webiny-applications/headless-cms/graphql-api#the-graphql-api-url-structure) key topic.

###
Finally, because the GraphQL API sits behind a security layer, we also need to create an API key, with an appropriate Security Group tied to it.
