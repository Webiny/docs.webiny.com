## Introduction

Webiny makes it easy to deploy your project, using the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) and [Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) as the default infrastructure as code and deployment solution. You can also easily deploy your project into multiple [environments](/docs/key-topics/deployment/environments), which is covered in this guide as well.

## AWS Credentials
In order to deploy your Webiny project, you need to have AWS Credentials properly configured on your machine. Furthermore, you can also deploy your project using a specific AWS profile.

To learn more, please check out the [Configure AWS Credentials](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/configure-aws-credentials) guide. If you're looking for information on how to use a  different AWS profile, feel free to skip to the [Using different AWS Profiles](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/configure-aws-credentials#using-a-different-aws-profile-name) section.

## The `deploy` Command

The `deploy` command can be used to completely deploy your project, or just a specific project application.

:::info
As explained in the [introduction to deployment](/docs/key-topics/deployment/introduction) key topic, doing a complete project deployment entails deploying all of its [project applications](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages).
:::

### Deploying the Whole Project
To completely deploy your project, simply run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```
yarn webiny deploy
```

This command deploys all of the three applications that are, by default, included in every Webiny project. It deploys them in the following order:

<!-- vale off -->
1. **API** (`./api`) - your project's GraphQL API
2. **Admin Area** (`./apps/admin`) - your administration area
3. **Website** (`./apps/website`) - your public website
<!-- vale on -->

:::info
Note that the first deployment can take up to 20 minutes! So even though it might look like nothing is happening in the terminal, please be patient and let the process finish. If something went wrong, an error will be shown, and the process will exit with an appropriate error code.
:::

### Environments
In general, when deploying projects or project applications, an [environment](/docs/key-topics/deployment/environments) must be specified. The above shown `deploy` command deploys your project into the `dev` environment by default, but you can also specify a different environment with the `--env` argument. For example, to deploy your project into the `prod` environment, you can run the following command:

```
yarn webiny deploy --env prod
```

### Deploying a Project Application

To deploy a specific project application, located withing your Webiny project, simple append the path to the folder in which the project application resides, for example:

```
yarn webiny deploy api --env dev
yarn webiny deploy apps/admin --env dev
yarn webiny deploy apps/site --env dev
```

Note that when deploying a specific project application, the environment (`--env`) argument is not optional, it must always be set.

## Building the Application Code

It's worth mentioning that the deployment commands shown above also build your application code. They perform this task by just running the following [`workspaces run`](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/working-with-workspaces) command:

```
yarn webiny workspaces run build --folder {STACK_FOLDER}
```

The command first finds all packages that are located in the project application folder. Then, for every found package, it runs the `build` command that's specified in the `webiny.config.js` - a configuration file that every package possesses. If the `build` command is defined, it gets executed, otherwise, the process just continues with the next package.

## Troubleshooting

#### Deploying my project takes a long time to finish

We're aware of this fact, and this is mainly because of the [Amazon ElasticSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/). While other cloud infrastructure resources get deployed reasonably fast, this service can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to become ready.

Unfortunately, this is a well-known issue for quite some time, and until the present, there haven't been any positive improvements.
