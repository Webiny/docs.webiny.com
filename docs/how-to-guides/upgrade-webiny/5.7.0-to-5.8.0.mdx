## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.8.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.8.0`.

## Upgrade Headless CMS

### Add DynamoDB + Elasticsearch plugins

Due to some internal changes in how we store data to the database you must add new plugins to the Headless CMS and GraphQL API lambdas.

First, you need to add new package to the `package.json` file in the `api/code/headlessCMS`, in the `dependencies` section.

```json title="api/code/headlessCMS/package.json"
"dependencies": {
	....
	"@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es": "^5.8.0"
	....
}
```

Then you need import the plugin from the new `@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es` package.

```typescript title="api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts"
// somewhere after the last import
import headlessCmsDynamoDbElasticsearch from "@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es";

// in the end of the createHandler function
headlessCmsDynamoDbElasticsearch(),
```

After that you are done with the Headless CMS, you do the same thing for the`api/code/graphql` `package.json` and `index.ts` file.
```json title="api/code/graphql/package.json"
"dependencies": {
	....
	"@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es": "^5.8.0"
	....
}
```

Then you import the plugin from the `@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es` package.

```typescript title="api/code/graphql/src/index.ts"
// somewhere after the last import
import headlessCmsDynamoDbElasticsearch from "@webiny/api-headless-cms-ddb-es";

// in the end of the createHandler function
headlessCmsDynamoDbElasticsearch(),
```

When you are done with import, re-deploy your API code.

```shell
yarn webiny deploy api --env=YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

### Upgrade in the Admin

When your API code is deployed go to your admin url and there should be an upgrade screen.
If upgrade screen does not show, try to clear cookies, local storage and log back in.

:::note
If there is still no upgrade screen, verify that you have done the previous step correctly.
:::

On the upgrade screen it says that this process will update all the content entries with new values:
* `tenant` - we must know which tenant is holder of the record
* `entryId` - helps with filtering - you can now find the entry which is published or latest without knowing the version of the entry

Clicking on the `Upgrade` button the upgrade API call is triggered and the upgrade starts.
Depending on the amount of the data you have it might take few seconds to complete.

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade feel free to give us a shout on our [Community Slack #headless-cms](https://webiny-community.slack.com/archives/C0147R8166P) channel.
