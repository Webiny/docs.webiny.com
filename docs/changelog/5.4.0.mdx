# Changes

This document highlights the most important fixes, improvements, and features, that were introduced in Webiny `5.4.0`.

## Headless CMS

### Reference Field - Added Item Reordering Control

The reference field can be used to reference one or more published content entries. But, up until now, once multiple entries were picked, there wasn't a way to reorder them.

This is now possible with the new reorder button (<svg style={{ verticalAlign: "middle"}} xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24px" fill="#000000"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3 15h18v-2H3v2zm0 4h18v-2H3v2zm0-8h18V9H3v2zm0-6v2h18V5H3z"/></svg>), located on the left side of each item in the list of all entries. Once clicked, a simple number input will be shown, into which a new order number of the active entry is typed. To complete the reordering, you can either press **Enter** to confirm the new order, or **Escape** to cancel.

# How To Upgrade

If you are already using Webiny version 5.3.x, then there are no special migration steps that need to be taken. So, when ready to upgrade, in your terminal of choice, simply run the following commands:

- `yarn up "@webiny/*@5.4.0"`
- `yarn webiny deploy`

On the other hand, if youâ€™re coming from an older version of Webiny, before upgrading, make sure to check our [How To Upgrade](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview) guide.
